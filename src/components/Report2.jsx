                        <p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">Greetings, and thank you for reading my F24 Workterm report. I hope that in reading this report you are able to better understand my role and responsibilities working at the University during my second work term at the school providing technical support for clients.</p>
<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">For the fall term I returned for the last 4 months of my 8 month term working as a Student IT Technician at the school. I worked my first 4 months in Johnston Hall providing support for clients and this term I was working specifically providing support for OVC clients. As I stated last term, OVC really is a sprawling building that easily makes up for a third of the campus spaces and buildings. It is world renowned for animal sciences and I had the opportunity to support multiple systems there working as an MD Technician in OVC. Similarly to Johnston Hall we provided the same services of helping repair computers and help clients. In terms of the most related areas in computer science to my specific department, I would actually change my answer from last term and say information systems and human computer interaction. I think this because our jobs handle the logistics of how the staff access their computers and we implement many different systems to ensure that the interaction and setup for new university devices is as seamless as possible, which is important as new trends constantly come along and people need to be taught how to use them effectively.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">I had a few goals for this term that build on what I had listed in the summer while also trying to foster some new skills too.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">Firstly, I wanted to take on more tasks that require physical networking or support. I didnt have the opportunity to do this as much in JH, and I wanted to take the opportunity to get more hands on experience with the different technologies and tools that are used in OVC.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">Secondly, I wanted to improve my time management and multitasking skills. In OVC specifically, this was important because most requests were in person and I had to factor in the time for physical labor and other factors when dealing with tickets. As well I took courses so I prioritized good time management so I can get all of my work tasks done in a timely manner so I can either take on more tasks or afford myself time to work on schoolwork.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">Thirdly, I wanted to improve my communication skills this term specifically in terms of customer service and in person interaction with clients.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">Finally, I wanted to take on more complex tasks than I did last term, such as making new SOP's as I had done before, specifically for OVC, to make handling uncommon tickets easier. This would help me improve the depth and breadth of my IT knowledge and OVC specific knowledge and thus improve my skills in helping people diagnose issues as well.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">I would say that my last goal was related to my job tasks specifically. I wanted to take on some more initiative by helping with some larger more complex tasks at OVC. I also tried to write more SOPs and WIs to contribute to the team outside of fulfilling tickets.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">I think I learned all of the skills that I had wanted to this term. I became more proficient in Footprints and AD, which are crucial support tools, and I definitely improved my personal soft skills and my communication skills throughout the term. These soft transferable skills are all beneficial to future work terms and I believe that they show I have more than just the technical skills for the job, it shows that I have had experience learning and solving problems in a work environment for a client.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">In terms of technologies I wanted to work with I simply continued improving my proficiency in the administration tools used on campus such as Active Directory, MECM, Footprints, Office, among a few others. In learning all of these tools and how to troubleshoot them I think that is useful because these tools are critical to networking, support and IT admin jobs. Having a good knowledge in these technologies would be a strong foundation for any QA engineering, support or technical analyst roles.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">Reflecting on my learning goals I would say I was successful in completing them. In regards to more in person support and networking I would say that I completed that goal. I would say a good portion of my work was in person support for clients which was nice. Whether it be helping fix broken setups, swapping out parts or helping install new parts and software. Or just coordinating to move around the surface hubs and fix problems that informatics needed us on site for. I was also able to provide support for some old systems and medical computers and cameras when they needs some computers changed out too.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">For my second goal, I believe that I managed my time effectively as proven by my prompt resolutions to all the tickets I received while also maintaining a 92% in my courses.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">For my third goal, due to the nature of all of the increased in person meetings I was able to improve my customer service and interaction skills. Iâ€™ve found that actively listening to clients' concerns and responding with clear, concise information has helped improve the quality of my interactions.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">Finally, for my last goal, While I didn't create more SOPs or WIs till the end of term (turns out most stuff is covered well). I did get the opportunity to help handle a few larger assignments for the clean out of MacNabb house on campus and the transferring of multiple departments to different offices. I learned teamwork with my fellow coops as I went to MacNabb and helped plan out the logistics for cleaning out all of the old technology. Jonathan and I also handled how many new supplies would need to be ordered for the new setups when we handled that ticket and we handled the moving and testing of all of the new and old equipment.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">An overview of my Job would once again be providing technical support to MD clients located in the OVC buildings. This ranged from online appointments, to physical appointments such as learning how to use surface hubs, or in person installs for certain pierces of software. We also handled a few builds, as well as in person support for clients using informations machines, so collaborating with their team was key to our success too. The most interesting and unique aspect to me this term was once again the variety of work to be done, even more so that Johnston Hall, OVC had tons of different technology from different eras that were still in various stages of support. So the variety of tickets coming in was interesting and I was always working on a new challenge. I was also able to contribute to the larger things like cleaning out MacNabb which was cool because MacNabb had a lot of old and interesting technology for us to go through. Once again for skills needed I would say that having good time management, communication, and customer service, as well as a strong analytical mind are crucial for success in this job. I think that these skills were learned both in class and on the job, learning how to think like a developer, and having a strong analytical mind in class. But I definitely learned the customer service and interaction skills primarily through my job experiences in the past S24 Term and prior.</p>

<p className="my-2 max-w-xl py-6 font-light tracking-tighter">By reading my F24 report I hope you were able to understand my role as a Technician working at the school but also how I was able to improve on my existing technical and soft skills. I hope you were able to see how I was able to improve over my 8 months at the school and some of the interesting things I was involved with will having the opportunity to work on the OVC support side of Managed Desktops.</p>
